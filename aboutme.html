			<h4>So :</h4>
			<p>I'm a 19 years old guy. I'm going to 20 soon. <br>
				I've started programmation when I was 12. I've stop it just to play video games and I've never continue.<br>
				Since 2 years, I retry it because I like create something with computer langage.<br>
				I've learned HTML when I was young, I started CSS when I took over programmaton.<br>
				Now, I try to learn JS and SQL for website. I also try to learn Python.
				<br>
				<br>
			I live with my family : my mom and my cat. I love them more than anything.
			<br> 
			I've also a friends that I consider like my brother because we are the same. 
			<br>
			<br>
			This website is going to be where I put my informations, my degrees, my projects and more after.
			<br>
			If you want to contribute at one of my projects, you can register and send me a message.
			<br>
			<br>
			Currently , I'm alone to do the website and all my projects but soon some friends will going to help me.
